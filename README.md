# Winter23_ClassProject_PHOTO_ALBUM_NARRATION

This project is web based. No installation is required.<br>
The idea behind having this project on a website is that it provides ease of access for people to use instead of downloading an app. 
It is also easier for people to share their album link for other people to watch them.<br>
We are going for a simple design for this website so that it will be easier for everyone with any skill or knowledge about technology.
The design includes large text, high contrast colors, and as little buttons as possible.<br>
We want to create a website for people of any age, any skill level, just to be able to upload their photos digitally and help them tell their story to their friends or family.<br>
Since the covid days, most people are unable to meet their friends or family, so this is a website to help them tell a story about them or a picture they chosen.<br>
This is still a work in progress.<br>

Design guidelines:
        - Design is crafted from older adult's feedback<br>
        - Headers were created with sufficent size and contrast<br>
        - Simple UI for easier navigation<br>
        - contrast tested using WAVE tool<br>
        - suitable font for better reading<br>
        - brief and easy to understand instruction<br>
        - buttons sufficiently spaced<br>
        - minimal pages design for better viewing<br>
